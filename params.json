WebBrowser control is very good for editing and parse HTML input from clipboard but it is not compatibile with WPF Layout.\r\n\r\n## Current Downloads:\r\n\r\n[YATE v1.01 Release: Source Code (zip)](https://github.com/alexiej/YATE/archive/v1.01.zip)\r\n\r\n[YATE v1.01 Release: Source Code (tar.gz)](https://github.com/alexiej/YATE/archive/v1.01.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n![MainWindow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/MainWindow.png)\r\n\r\nIn this situation I would like to present you YATE. \r\n\r\nYate is based on project Document.Editor from: https://documenteditor.codeplex.com/.\r\nInstead of using HTMLToXMLConverter,the Yate convert direct to FlowDocument. Old conversion doesn't support many features from HTML (like other size types, color types , etc..). \r\n\r\nThis is not and never will be full HTML conversion to FlowDocument but it helps to work with this type of input.\r\n\r\nIn this control you can:\r\n\r\n* Paste HTML input from clipboard with formatting, images, tables like in WebBrowser.\r\n\r\n![INSERT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/INSERT.gif)\r\n\r\n* Automatically recognize URL\r\n* Paste Images, by one command.\r\n* Resizing Images\r\n\r\n![RESIZE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/RESIZE.gif)\r\n\r\n* Many commands for edit RichTextBox.\r\n* Good looking Toolbar with MahApps.Metro style.\r\n* Export to (.XAML,.XPS,.PDF)\r\n* Table Operations\r\n\r\n![CREATE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/CREATE.png)\r\n\r\n![TABLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/TABLE.png)\r\n\r\n* Print Preview\r\n\r\n![TABLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/PRINT_PREVIEW.png)\r\n\r\n* Search TextBox\r\n\r\n![TABLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexiej/YATE/master/YATE.Win/docs/SEARCH.png)\r\n\r\n## Icons/Style\r\n\r\nYATE use style and icons from project Mahapss.Metro. https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro\r\n\r\n# Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Public License (Ms-PL)\r\n\r\nThis license governs use of the accompanying software.
